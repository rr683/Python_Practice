# Python_Practice
Python Practice: Leetcode, MITRE classes and Python Books
This is a repo that partially reflects my journey to getting acquainted with Computer Science through the lense of amateur mathematician
using python.

Purpose: Practice, practice, practice -- Aiming to start from the very basics and build towards doing intermediate-level exercises
and finally work on advanced algorithms ranging from optimization to machine learning
